 Created for INFSCI 1059 at the University of Pittsburgh. 

 Styling is minimal but functional and easy to use. All data that goes into the database is validated and sanitized. 
 
 Users are able to log into the forum or create an account. Users must be logged in to add topics or replies. Only admin users can create categories. Non-logged in users can view, but not create topics or replies. 

 On the home page, there are two "Empty Categories", the purpose of this is to show how empty categories and empty topics are handled.
